# Claude Queue

Automatically feed tasks to Claude Code and handle quota limits. This tool helps you maintain a continuous workflow with Claude Code by managing a queue of tasks and automatically retrying when quota limits are reached.

## Features

- üìã Queue-based task management using a simple markdown file
- ‚è∞ Automatic 15-minute check intervals for continuous processing
- üîÑ Smart quota limit handling with automatic retry
- üìù Comprehensive logging of all operations
- üñ•Ô∏è macOS keyboard automation for seamless integration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ClaudeQueue.git
cd ClaudeQueue
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x claude_queue.py
```

3. (Optional) Install cliclick for better keyboard automation:
```bash
brew install cliclick
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Create a `queue.md` file in your project directory with your tasks:
```markdown
# Tasks

- [ ] Fix the login form validation bug
- [ ] Add unit tests for the user service
- [ ] Update the API documentation
- [ ] Refactor the database connection module
```

2. Start Claude Code in a terminal window

3. In another terminal, run Claude Queue:
```bash
./claude_queue.py
```

4. When prompted, switch focus to your Claude Code terminal window

5. The script will automatically:
   - Send the initial queue to Claude
   - Check the queue every 15 minutes
   - Continue processing until interrupted

### Running from a Different Directory

You can specify a repository path as an argument:
```bash
./claude_queue.py /path/to/your/project
```

### Example Workflow

1. Create your task queue:
```markdown
# Development Queue

## High Priority
- [ ] Fix critical security vulnerability in auth module
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest versions

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] Implement new user profile feature
- [ ] Add integration tests for payment system

## Low Priority
- [ ] Refactor legacy code in utils module
- [ ] Update coding style guide documentation
```

2. Start the queue processor:
```bash
./claude_queue.py
```

3. Claude Code will:
   - Read the queue.md file
   - Start working on tasks
   - Remove completed items from the queue
   - Add new tasks if issues are discovered during implementation

4. Monitor progress in the `claude_queue.log` file:
```bash
tail -f claude_queue.log
```

## How It Works

1. **Queue Management**: Tasks are stored in a `queue.md` markdown file that Claude can read and update
2. **Automation**: Uses macOS keyboard automation (AppleScript/cliclick) to send messages to Claude Code
3. **Continuous Processing**: Checks the queue every 15 minutes to ensure continuous task processing
4. **Smart Retries**: Detects quota limit messages and automatically waits before retrying
5. **Logging**: All operations are logged to `claude_queue.log` for tracking and debugging

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- macOS (for keyboard automation)
- Claude Code CLI installed and running
- (Optional) cliclick for improved keyboard automation
